(M) maintenance [TIM]
  - rewrap document
  + add twmacros.tex
  - fix colors
  
(M) linear read [KARINA, TIM]

(M) Intro: update to reflect additional content [KARINA]
   - Tim to provide three-liner, putting in words what we did [TIM]
      - will be along the lines of, OLD: we present a way to compute
        fractures; NEW: we explore different ways to compute
        fractures, both based on Voronoi tesselations, as well as
        hierarchical fractures
        
(M) Related work: update to include fracture simulation (maybe three
    references or so...); incl. brief literature reserach [KARINA]

(M) Find bits that are needlessly specific to the given pot and generalise them.
    - it's still okay to say that the project was born from the desire
      to exhibit this particular pot as a puzzle  [KARINA -- at least highlight them]

(M) Update section "Post-processing all puzzle pieces and core" (with
    the pieces in the gallery) [KARINA]

(M) New section describing fracture approaches [TIM]

(M) Evaluation: add section in the end to demonstrate how approach
    generalises to wider range of shapes: here show the elephant [?; at
    any rate, KARINA will move figure there]

(M) Update conclusion accordingly

(S) Check whether we can really quote origin of elephant figurine; if yes, adapt text

(M): see todo's in the text [ALL]
