abstract="This paper investigates digitally fabricated replicas and how these contribute as novel interpretative means to support visitor experiences in cultural heritage contexts. The paper's main contribution is the evaluation of the experience that visually impaired users had with a 3d printed relief of a Victorian environmental display, or diorama, from the Booth Museum of Natural History in Brighton (UK) along with a pervasive audio mobile application. Our intention is to illuminate the subtleties, interests and learning through experiences with objects and supporting interpretative applications in the cultural heritage sector.",

abstract = {The Smithsonian Institution and the Tlingit community of southeast Alaska have collaborated on several initiatives to 3D digitize important cultural objects for preservation and educational purposes. For some projects, the Smithsonian created 3D replicas of objects repatriated by the National Museum of Natural History to the Tlingit community as sacred objects, objects of cultural patrimony and funerary objects. The Tlingit and Smithsonian recognize that 3D digitization provides a form of security against the loss of cultural objects and allows for reproduction and restoration in various forms. The production of physical replicas also creates the opportunity to further educational goals while the original objects remain in use for ceremony or in seclusion as restricted items. The collaborations between the Smithsonian and the Tlingit illustrate the potential for responsible applications of digital technology to transform museum-indigenous relations in a wide range of areas.},

@book{Tilden1977,
abstract = {Every year millions of Americans visit national parks and monuments, state and municipal parks, battlefields, historic houses, and museums. By means of guided walks and talks, tours, exhibits, and signs, visitors experience these areas through a very special kind of communication technique known as "interpretation." For fifty years, Freeman Tilden'sInterpreting Our Heritagehas been an indispensable sourcebook for those who are responsible for developing and delivering interpretive programs. This expanded and revised anniversary edition includes not only Tilden's classic work but also an entirely new selection of accompanying photographs, five additional essays by Tilden on the art and craft of interpretation, a new foreword by former National Park Service director Russell Dickenson, and an introduction by R. Bruce Craig that puts Tilden's writings into perspective for present and future generations. Whether the challenge is to make a prehistoric site come to life; to explain the geological basis behind a particular rock formation; to touch the hearts and minds of visitors to battlefields, historic homes, and sites; or to teach a child about the wonders of the natural world, Tilden's book, with its explanation of the famed "six principles" of interpretation, provides a guiding hand. For anyone interested in our natural and historic heritage-park volunteers and rangers, museum docents and educators, new and seasoned professional heritage interpreters, and those lovingly characterized by Tilden as "happy amateurs"-Interpreting Our Heritageand Tilden's later interpretive writings, included in this edition, collectively provide the essential foundation for bringing into focus the truths that lie beyond what the eye sees.},

These have been selected as inputs to the classification on the basis of their volume, quality, consistency and sustainability. To be input into the classification, these data must enable accurate identification of, and discrimination between, a wide range of consumer behaviours. It must also monitor change over time to ensure an accurate assignment of a Mosaic UK code to a person, household address or postcode. A further 1500 data elements were used in clustering did not directly affect the solution, but were used as descriptives when evaluating the segmentation. 72 per cent of the information used to build Mosaic UK is sourced from a combination of data that includes Experian's UK ConsumerView Database, which provides consumer demographic information for the UK's 50 million adults and 25 million households. This database is built from an unrivalled variety of privacy-compliant public and Experian proprietary data and statistical models. These include the edited Electoral Roll, Council Tax property valuations, house sale prices, self-reported lifestyle surveys, term time students from HESA, social housing information from NROSH, broadband speed information from OFCOM, and other compiled consumer data. The remaining 28 per cent of the data are sourced from the 2011 Census which provides highly accurate neighbourhood level information. All of the information used to build Mosaic is continuously updated. This enables Experian to verify and update the classification annually, and the segmentation has been built in such a way that new data can be can be added to provide further insight into the Types.},

abstract = {This paper investigates personas, an alternative method for representing and communicating customer needs. By using a narrative, picture, and name, a persona provides product designers with a vivid representation of the design target. Numerous benefits of incorporating personas into product design approaches have been suggested, but the present literature fails to identify the most significant and universal advantages of persona use. By incorporating expert opinion through the use of Delphi methodology, this research first examines the benefits of incorporating personas into design processes. After gaining consensus on the perceived importance of the individual benefits, this paper then elaborates on the most significant benefits of persona use and needed future research on the personas method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Dawson2011,
abstract = {This article assesses the use of audience segmentation in visitor studies by ana-lyzing its application in the identity model of visitors proposed by J. Falk (2009) and J. Falk et al. (2007). As a leading example of visitor segmentation, the authors examine this model's application in a specific case at U.S. zoos to elaborate some of its limitations. Conventional short-term, episodic approaches to visitor research should be challenged and supplemented by a more contextually sensitive framework. The authors contend that segmentation approaches, and in particular Falk's theoriza-tion and operationalization of an identity model of visitors, are problematic. They argue for a contextual turn that places visitors' experiences within a holistic and long-term framework of individual life circumstances, relationships, and trajectories. Research and theory from education, sociology, and cultural studies extends existing visitor research approaches by acknowledging complexity, change over time, and the interwoven and developmental nature of sociocultural variables influencing visitors' appropriation of new ideas and experiences. Museum, gallery, and zoo visitors have been the subject of a great deal of research interest in recent years. However, to date little headway has been made in terms of developing a rigorous and valid theoretical understanding of visitors to such cultural institutions, 1 their reasons for visiting and the value such visits hold for them. In seeking to address these issues, audience segmentation approaches, initially developed to model consumer behaviors for marketing purposes, have been adapted for visitor studies. Segmentation methods break visitors into subgroups for purposes of analysis and intervention. While judicious use of taxonomic approaches can offer advantages for visitor studies and cultural institutions, we identify a number of disadvantages that undermine the value of audience segmentation for visitor research. In this article we critique the theorization of audience segmentation currently being taken up by leading visitor studies researchers by exploring the identity model of museum visitors proposed by Falk (2009), as well as the development and application of this model in 127},

abstract = {Although John Dewey's educational concepts have been discussed previously in relation to museums, his own writing about museums has received little attention. Dewey, who visited museums frequently throughout his life, recognized the powerful educational value of museums. He assigned a central role to museums as integrative components of raw experiences in his educational theory, and he made extensive use of student visits to museums at the Chicago Laboratory School. Early twentieth-cen-tury museum educators and directors applied Dewey's ideas, and advocated a muse-um education philosophy, based on the progressive education movement, that has significance for current exhibition and educational practice.},

@book{Roppola2012,
abstract = {Exhibition environments are enticingly complex spaces: as facilitators of experience; as free-choice learning contexts; as theaters of drama; as encyclopedic warehouses of cultural and natural heritage; as two-, three- and four-dimensional storytellers; as sites for self-actualizing leisure activity. But how much do we really know about the moment-by-moment transactions that comprise the intricate experiences of visitors? To strengthen the disciplinary knowledge base supporting exhibition design, we must understand more about what 'goes on' as people engage with the multifaceted communication environments that are contemporary exhibition spaces. The in-depth, visitor-centered research underlying this book offers nuanced understandings of the interface between visitors and exhibition environments. Analysis of visitors' meaning-making accounts shows that the visitor experience is contingent upon four processes: framing, resonating, channeling, and broadening. These processes are distinct, yet mutually influencing. Together they offer an evidence-based conceptual framework for understanding visitors in exhibition spaces. Museum educators, designers, interpreters, curators, researchers, and evaluators will find this framework of value in both daily practice and future planning. Designing for the Museum Visitor Experience provides museum professionals and academics with a fresh vocabulary for understanding what goes on as visitors wander around exhibitions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Tiina Roppola.

We somewhat agree, arguing that 3D printing holds great socioeconomic implications, but also that more sustained attention should be paid to the ways in which 3D printing is entering into our creative environments. Our focus in this article is on the use of rapid prototyping by creatives such as architects, designers, and DIY advocates, since it is within these contexts where the popular themes of 3D printing are currently most concrete. To this end, in section one we provide some background for desktop digital fabrication, contextualizing 3D printing within industrial processes and Maker subcultures. In section two, we summarize our environmental scan of relevant popular and academic literature, using this to identify key trends in this area. We supplement this discussion in section three using our analysis of a ‘critical making' session that took participants through a process of designing and printing simple objects as well as follow–up interviews with these participants. In the concluding section, we target four areas in need of future research.},

@phdthesis{Studart2000,
abstract = {This study explores the part that child-orientated exhibitions play in the child and family$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmuseum experience. Such exhibitions are characterised by their distinctive approaches to$\backslash$r$\backslash$nlearning, interpretation, and design, being especially devised for children. The research was$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncarried out in children's galleries from three types of museum (a maritime museum, a science$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmuseum, and a children's museum) in order to compare and contrast similarities and$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndifferences between them. Since most of the research in this area has been carried out in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nscience centres or science museums, there is a need to explore the situation in child-orientated$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexhibitions and compare it to studies carried out in other informal learning settings.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nUnderstanding the qualities of their experience in a child-orientated exhibition which children$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand families value and why and how design and interpretation decisions may affect family$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbehaviour, perceptions, and learning, will enable educators, museum designers and other$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmuseum professionals to plan more responsive and meaningful child-centred exhibitions.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nChildren from seven to eleven years old and their accompanying adults were considered in this$\backslash$r$\backslash$nstudy. The research involves both qualitative and quantitative approaches and the use of$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndifferent methods of investigation, such as face-to-face interviews with children and an adult$\backslash$r$\backslash$nrelative; unobtrusive observation of family group interactions at three exhibits in each gallery;$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand collection of children's drawings about their favourite exhibit in the galleries. The sample$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsizes for each investigation varied: 150 families, totaling 300 individuals, were interviewed (150$\backslash$r$\backslash$nadults and 150 children); 450 different family groups were observed at the galleries (150 in$\backslash$r$\backslash$neach gallery); and 120 children's drawings were collected. The guiding principle was to adopt$\backslash$r$\backslash$nan holistic approach to the situation under investigation, taking into consideration Falk \&$\backslash$r$\backslash$nDierking's interactive museum experience model (Falk \& Dierking, 1992), which considers the$\backslash$r$\backslash$npersonal, social, and physical contexts of a museum visit.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nFindings from the observations indicated gender effects in adult splitting behaviour from the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfamily group at exhibits according to family members joint-activity compositions, and that$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndifferences in exhibit design/tasks affected adult manipulation of hands-on exhibits and the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nlevel of proximity between family members. Nine attributes from attractive child-orientated$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexhibits were drawn from the observed exhibits: element of fun, challenging situation, element$\backslash$r$\backslash$nof surprise, child-sized exhibit design, imaginative design, opportunity for experiencing things,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nopportunity for role play, interactive machine/game, and teamwork. The analysis of the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nchildren's drawings revealed that drawings can be a valuable source of information about$\backslash$r$\backslash$nchildren's interactions with hands-on exhibits and can be used to assess children's$\backslash$r$\backslash$nunderstanding of exhibits through the depiction of the exhibit outcomes.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe interview data was analysed qualitatively (inductive content analysis) and statistically (chi-squared$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntests). The analysis of the open-ended interview questions indicated that adult$\backslash$r$\backslash$nrelatives were enthusiastic about the opportunity for the children to interact with exhibits and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nperceived the hands-on gallery approach as motivating to the child with regard to learning.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nChildren perceived the exhibitions as exciting places and reported positive feelings. A few$\backslash$r$\backslash$nchildren mentioned negative feelings, which were related to problematic exhibit design. The$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmajority of children said that they prefer to visit museums in a family context rather than in a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nschool context. The statistical analysis of the closed questions indicated twenty-two significant$\backslash$r$\backslash$nassociations between the adults' and children's interview variables, related to adults' and/or$\backslash$r$\backslash$nchildren's age, gender, education, perceptions, behaviour, preferences, visiting habits, and type$\backslash$r$\backslash$nof museum, supporting the notion that personal, social, and museum aspects affect the child's$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand adult's museum experience, perceptions and learning. Children's perceptions of their$\backslash$r$\backslash$nlearning in the galleries were found to be affected by the time spent in the gallery, the type of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmuseum, the accompanying relative, and the child's preference for the social context of the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmuseum visit.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis investigation provided new insights into the study of galleries designed for children, and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nhas demonstrated that child-orientated exhibitions have features which positively affect the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nchild and family museum experience, that children do perceive that they are learning in this$\backslash$r$\backslash$nenvironment, and that it is a effective catalyst for family social activity. Therefore, child-orientated$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexhibitions are a valuable museum provision for the child and family audiences.},

abstract = {This thesis explores the family museum experience from the point of view of the family members. When families visit museums they bring with them their own agenda. Analysing the components of the family agenda illuminates the frameworks through which families perceive their museum visit. Hands-on museums (or exhibitions within museums) were chosen as case studies because they provide for family visitors and, thus, they are more likely to satisfy a wider range of family agendas. Indeed, different types of agendas - including agendas for adults, children and an agenda for learning - were considered. Based on the analysis of the data collected in three institutions, a family agenda model was developed. Five factors were identified as determining the family museum agenda: the family profile, socio-cultural patterns, the personal and the social context of the visit and the museum exhibition(s). The interaction of these factors creates the agenda for the visit and also influences the way the visit is perceived and reconstructed by family members. All the members of the family are actively involved in constructing the agenda. The museum agenda can also challenge the family agenda. Hence the family agenda is constructed, negotiated and refined before, during and after the visit itself.The methodology used to collect data was qualitative in nature and involved observing and interviewing all the family members of 86 groups in three hands-on museums/exhibitions. Children's drawings were also used. The analysis was performed on data collected on site at the following institutions: the Xperiment! Gallery at the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester; Eureka! the Museum for Children, Halifax; and the Archaeological Resource Centre, York.},

abstract = {In the last years, the development of 3D technologies applied to the field of Cultural Heritage (CH) has led to results of the utmost importance from the point of view of preservation, valorisation, communication and fruition of our assets. In particular, we experienced many interdisciplinary projects in which, thanks to the cooperation of different fields of research, incredible results have been obtained, through the technological collaboration of computer graphics and documentation, of industrial engineering and preservation and access of CH. This paper aims at drawing attention to the actual technologies in use for solid printing (digital fabrication) used for the realization of material copies, therefore tangible, of three-dimensional digital virtual models. Even though ulterior developments to these technologies are possibilities to be expected, the process of 3D printing has gradually gained levels of accuracy, which can nowadays be deemed as satisfying. This is even more true in the industrial field (from the manufacturing industry to the design industry), but also in other fields, such as the medical one, for example, for the realization of artificial limbs, and the CH field, which can benefit from new instruments for the restoration and preservation of cultural assets in museums. The metric characteristics of precision and accuracy of the model printed with 3D technology are the fundaments for everything concerning Geomatics, and have to be related with the same characteristics of the digital model obtained through the survey analysis. In other terms, the precision of the printed product must be evaluated in relation to the precision of the instruments used in the analysis. Thus, in the CH field there is the possibility of new systems of access, cataloguing and study, where the models, both virtual and tangible, represent the fundament of visualization and analysis of the form (also from the metric point of view) of each artefact of artistic and historical interest.},

abstract = {The Labeled Magnitude Scale (LMS) is a semantic scale of perceptual intensity characterized by a quasi-logarithmic spacing of its verbal labels. The LMS had previously been shown to yield psychophysical functions equivalent to magnitude estimation (ME) when gustatory, thermal and nociceptive stimuli were presented and rated together, and the upper bound of the LMS was defined as the 'strongest imaginable oral sensation'. The present study compared the LMS to ME within the more limited contexts of taste and smell. In Experiment 1, subjects used both methods to rate either taste intensity produced by sucrose and NaC1 or odor intensity produced by acetic acid and phenyl ethyl alcohol, with the upper bound of the LMS defined as either the 'strongest imaginable taste' or the 'strongest imaginable odor'. The LMS produced psychophysical functions equivalent to those produced by ME. In, Experiment 2 a new group of subjects used both methods to rate the intensity of three different taste qualities, with the upper bound of the LMS defined as the 'strongest imaginable [sweetness, saltiness, or bitterness]'. In all three cases the LMS produced steeper functions than did ME. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that the LMS yields data comparable to ME only when the perceptual domain under study includes painful sensations. This hypothesis was supported when the LMS again produced steeper functions that ME after subjects had been explicitly instructed to omit painful sensations (e.g. the 'burn' of hot peppers) from the concept of 'strongest imaginable taste'. We conclude that the LMS can be used to scale sensations of taste and smell when they are broadly defined, but that it should be modified for use in scaling specific taste (and probably odor) qualities. The implications of these results for theoretical issues related to ME, category-ratio scales and the size of the perceptual range in different sensory modalities are discussed.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a semantically labeled hedonic scale (LHS) that would yield ratio-level data on the magnitude of liking/disliking of sensation equivalent to that produced by magnitude estimation (ME). The LHS was constructed by having 49 subjects who were trained in ME rate the semantic magnitudes of 10 common hedonic descriptors within a broad context of imagined hedonic experiences that included tastes and flavors. The resulting bipolar scale is statistically symmetrical around neutral and has a unique semantic structure. The LHS was evaluated quantitatively by comparing it with ME and the 9-point hedonic scale. The LHS yielded nearly identical ratings to those obtained using ME, which implies that its semantic labels are valid and that it produces ratio-level data equivalent to ME. Analyses of variance conducted on the hedonic ratings from the LHS and the 9-point scale gave similar results, but the LHS showed much greater resistance to ceiling effects and yielded normally distributed data, whereas the 9-point scale did not. These results indicate that the LHS has significant semantic, quantitative, and statistical advantages over the 9-point hedonic scale.},

abstract = {Stroop and Simon tasks are logically similar and are often used to investigate cognitive control and inhibition processes. We compare the distributional properties of Stroop and Simon effects with delta plots and find dif- ferent although stable patterns. Stroop effects across a variety of conditions are smallest for fast responses and increase as responses slow. Simon effects across a variety of conditions, however, are largest for fast responses but decrease, and even reverse, as responses slow. We show in three experiments that these diverging patterns hold within participants and even when the stimulus materials are identical across the tasks. These stable dif- ferences in time course serve as bedrock phenomena for building and testing theories of cognitive control and inhibition. The results of two additional experiments suggest that the determinant of time course is not simply whether the distracting information is location.},

@article{Auffarth2013,
abstract = {The main problem with sensory processing is the difficulty in relating sensory input to physiological responses and perception. This is especially problematic at higher levels of processing, where complex cues elicit highly specific responses. In olfaction, this relationship is particularly obfuscated by the difficulty of characterizing stimulus statistics and perception. The core questions in olfaction are hence the so-called stimulus problem, which refers to the understanding of the stimulus, and the structure-activity and structure-odor relationships, which refer to the molecular basis of smell. It is widely accepted that the recognition of odorants by receptors is governed by the detection of physico-chemical properties and that the physical space is highly complex. Not surprisingly, ideas differ about how odor stimuli should be classified and about the very nature of information that the brain extracts from odors. Even though there are many measures for smell, there is none that accurately describes all aspects of it. Here, we summarize recent developments in the understanding of olfaction. We argue that an approach to olfactory function where information processing is emphasized could contribute to a high degree to our understanding of smell as a perceptual phenomenon emerging from neural computations. Further, we argue that combined analysis of the stimulus, biology, physiology, and behavior and perception can provide new insights into olfactory function. We hope that the reader can use this review as a competent guide and overview of research activities in olfactory physiology, psychophysics, computation, and psychology. We propose avenues for research, particularly in the systematic characterization of receptive fields and of perception. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

They received no advance cue, a superordinate-level name as cue, or a superordinate and basic-level name as cue. The objects varied in size relative to the fingertip and in the most diagnostic attribute, either texture or shape. The data suggest that object recognition can occur when global volumetric primitives cannot directly be extracted. Even with no cue, confusion errors resembled the target object and indicated extraction of material and local shape information, which was sufficient to provide accuracy above 20{\%}. Performance improved with cuing, and the effect of exposure duration was observed primarily with minimal cuing, indicating compensatory effects of top-down processing.},

abstract = {This review of kinaesthesia, the senses of limb position and limb movement, has been prompted by recent new observations on the role of motor commands in position sense. They make it necessary to reassess the present-day views of the underlying neural mechanisms. Peripheral receptors which contribute to kinaesthesia are muscle spindles and skin stretch receptors. Joint receptors do not appear to play a major role at most joints. The evidence supports the existence of two separate senses, the sense of limb position and the sense of limb movement. Receptors such as muscle spindle primary endings are able to contribute to both senses. While limb position and movement can be signalled by both skin and muscle receptors, new evidence has shown that if limb muscles are contracting, an additional cue is provided by centrally generated motor command signals. Observations using neuroimaging techniques indicate the involvement of both the cerebellum and parietal cortex in a multi-sensory comparison, involving operation of a forward model between the feedback during a movement and its expected profile, based on past experience. Involvement of motor command signals in kinaesthesia has implications for interpretations of certain clinical conditions.},

Lexicons within these dimensions were found to be slightly different in responsive sensitiveness under different conditions (material surface finish, sensory conditions, subject groups etc.). A comparison was made between visual touch and blindfold touch. With the proposed dimension-lexicon system, people could subjectively describe the material texture in a common way.},

abstract = {The paper examines museum evaluation activities in their social and political context and advocates the need for evaluation strategies in the cultural sector. It analyses the case of the Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery in Glasgow, which commissioned the design of such a strategy as part of its current project for the redevelopment of displays and visitor facilities. The Strategy covered the evaluation of the new displays, of orientation provision, of the new and improved facilities, as well as information to inform future policies and plans. The paper examines methodological issues related to the design of the evaluation strategy and to evaluation work at the Museum in general. It also examines the objectives set by the specific project and the relevant actions suggested by the strategy in order to meet these. Finally, it critically examines the role and effectiveness of evaluation in this context.},

abstract = {This article reviews recent research on perception of tangible pictures in sighted and blind people. Haptic picture naming accuracy is dependent upon familiarity and access to semantic memory, just as in visual recognition. Performance is high when haptic picture recognition tasks do not depend upon semantic memory. Viewpoint matters for the ease or difficulty of interpreting haptic pictures of solid objects. Top views were easiest for sighted and blind persons when geometrical solids had constant cross-sections in the vertical axis. The presence or absence of viewpoint effects depends upon the nature of the solids that are represented. Congenitally blind people do not spontaneously produce perspective drawings, but recent data suggests that depictions including linear perspective can be understood after minimal experience. The results suggest that two-dimensional configurations are not necessarily problematic for touch. Touch is a remarkable sense, and it is just beginning to reveal its secrets to persistent researchers. Much more time and energy have been devoted to the study of picture perception in vision than in touch. Until recently, most researchers have questioned whether touch is capable of getting useful spatial information from pictures, and have argued that the sense of touch is far more suitable for the understanding of three-dimensional objects and the surface qualities of objects (Revesz, 1950; but see Kennedy, 1993). Many blind people around the world have had little formal education in graphics or maps, and most have had no exposure to tangible pictures. In our current society, blind people are increasingly dependent upon the use of computers for communication, as are most of us. Current computer operating systems typically use graphical user interfaces, and so an understanding of spatial perception of blind people and two-dimensional displays take on added importance. Most researchers in this area have assumed that congenitally blind people only differ from the sighted and late blind in their lack of visual experience, and presumably lack of visual imagery. This notion has been used as a rationale for evaluating the impact of a lack of visual imagery on},

The data to be printed can be derived from a 3D model and such 3D model can also be used to guide shaping of the substrate. The 3D model can be produced from 2D image data. If the 2D image data is a two-dimensional portrait photograph, a result, of using the present invention, can be a realistic portrait in the form of a bas-relief sculpture.},

We present a computer-assisted workflow for the creation of tactile representations of paintings, suitable to be used as a learning tool in the context of guided tours in museums or galleries. Starting from high-resolution images of original paintings, our process allows an artist to quickly design the desired form, and generate data suitable for rapid prototyping machines to produce the physical touch tools. Laser-cut layered depth diagrams convey not only the individual objects in the painting and their spatial layout, but also augment their depth relations. CNC-milled textured reliefs additionally render fine details like brush strokes and texture suitable for the sense of touch. Our methods mimic aspects of the visual sense, make sure that the haptic output is quite faithful to the original paintings, and do not require special manual abilities like sculpting skills.},

Second, we sketch a concept for the autonomous, interactive exploration of tactile reliefs, in the form of a gesture-controlled audio guide, based on recent depth cameras. Especially the combination of both approaches promises rapid tactile accessibility to 2.5D spatial information in a home or education setting, to on-line resources, or as a kiosk installation in museums.},

To define appropriate roles for haptic interaction, it is necessary to integrate a basic awareness of human capabilities on one hand and current device technology on the other. Here, I explore this integration by first summarizing the most salient constraints imposed by both humans and hardware. I then proceed to relate perceptual, motor, and attentional capabilities to a selection of emerging application contexts chosen to be relevant to contemporary design trends and opportunities. These include abstract communication and notification, augmentation of graphical user interfaces, expressive control, affective communication, and mobile and handheld computing.},

Accordingly, the creation of integrated systems including both tactile media (e.g., bas-reliefs) and interfaces capable of providing the users with an experience cognitively comparable to the one originally envisioned by the artist, may be considered the next step for enhancing artworks exploration. In light of this, the present work provides a description of a first-attempt system designed to aid blind people (BP) in the tactile exploration of bas-reliefs. In detail, consistent hardware layout, comprising a hand-tracking system based on Kinect{\textregistered} sensor and an audio device, together with a number of methodologies, algorithms and information related to physical design are proposed. Moreover, according to experimental test on the developed system related to the device position, some design alternatives are suggested so as to discuss pros and cons.},

Independent groups of ten each of sighted controls, early-blind, and late-blind subjects were told to identify the vantage point of tangible pictures of the model, including side views, 'bird's-eye' views from above, and views involving linear perspective. The ease or difficulty of picture interpretation depended upon the nature of the tangible drawing, with much better performance being recorded for side views. Performance was poor for foreshortened 3/4 views. Early-blind subjects were particularly unlikely to recognize views from above. In a control experiment with blindfolded sighted subjects the influence of prior information was examined: some subjects were told that the drawings could consist of side view or bird's-eye, top view, or 3/4 view drawings. This experiment showed that performance can be greatly improved through prior information about the nature of the tangible pictures.},

abstract = {Mental mapping of spaces, and of the possible paths for navigating these spaces, is essential for the development of efficient orientation and mobility skills. Most of the information required for this mental mapping is gathered through the visual channel. Blind people lack this crucial information and in consequence face great difficulties (a) in generating efficient mental maps of spaces, and therefore (b) in navigating efficiently within these spaces. The work reported in this paper follows the assumption that the supply of appropriate spatial information through compensatory sensorial channels, as an alternative to the (impaired) visual channel, may contribute to the mental mapping of spaces and consequently, to blind people's spatial performance. The main goals of the study reported in this paper were: (a) The development of a multi-sensory virtual environment enabling blind people to learn about real life spaces which they are required to navigate (e.g., school, work place, public buildings); (b) A systematic study of blind people's acquisition of spatial navigation skills by means of the virtual environment; (c) A systematic study of the contribution of this mapping to blind people's spatial skills and performance in the real environment. In the paper a brief description of the virtual learning environment is presented, as well as preliminary results of two case studies of blind persons' learning process with the environment.},

abstract = {Drawing on interviews with blind people, this paper examines both their exclusion from museums and galleries and their responses to the art educational provision which is specifically designed to remedy that marginalisation. Blind visitors responses to these educational projects was polarised; respondents were either highly critical or very enthusiastic. This paper begins by outlining the interviewees criticisms which included, education officers misconception of how touch facilitates learning and aesthetic response, a lack of educational progression and blind peoples clear exclusion from mainstream events. I then ask why, given these problems, did other respondents respond so favourably, suggesting that these high levels of satisfaction were had little to do with museum provision but were the result of social interaction and of inclusion within the sighted community. I argue that, ironically, this sense of inclusion is premised on blind visitors structural exclusion from art institutions. Finally, the article examines those visitors who, illicitly or otherwise, already experience some aspects of the museum in multisensory terms but maintain that until museums and galleries ocularcentric orientation is reconfigured, there will be little possibility for these rogue visitors to develop their knowledge of art. Likewise, without institutional change educational events for the blind will continue to be an inadequate supplement to a structure that is and remains inequitable.},

abstract = {Museum professionals are increasingly looking to research as a means of uncovering answers to some fundamental questions about their audiences, exhibits, and programs. The first step in addressing such questions requires a clear understanding of various research tools. This paper looks at the characteristics of three different interview tools used in a study of museum visitors at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in Boston and explores the relative utility of the three types of data. Each tool reflects a distinct method for assessing specific audience experiences and learning. Each tool defines the parameters of the information gathered, yielding a particular portrait of the museum audience. Demographic studies focus on numbers. Attitudinal studies identify preferences. Developmental studies reveal logic, comprehension, motivation. Each has distinct implications for museum programming. A pilot study was designed to assess the audience at the ICA's " Currents " exhibit, focusing particular attention on educational needs. The study was done in late spring 1984, at a time when the ICA had instituted a new, athematic exhibit program consisting of parallel and interlocking exhibitions. This cross-section of the current art world exhibited several programs simultaneously in the areas of painting, sculpture, photography, video, film, and performance. One outcome of the study was to propose a means of enhancing the understanding of a broad range of visitors as to diverse contemporary art issues, styles, and media. Some of the work on display during the study was that of photographer Karl Baden, painters Elizabeth Murray and Susan Rothenberg, installation artist Jannis Kounellis, and video artist Dara Birnbaum, as well as movie publicity photographs organized by Diane Keaton and Marvin Heiferman.},

abstract = {Commonly used to produce the visual effect of full 3D scene on reduced depth supports, bas relief can be successfully employed to help blind people to access inherently bi-dimensional works of art. Despite a number of methods have been proposed dealing with the issue of recovering 3D or 2.5D surfaces from single images, only a few of them explicitly address the recovery problem from paintings and, more specifically, the needs of visually impaired and blind people. The main aim of the present paper is to provide a systematic method for the semi-automatic generation of 2.5D models from paintings. Consequently, a number of ad hoc procedures are used to solve most of the typical problems arising when dealing with artistic representation of a scene. Feedbacks provided by a panel of end-users demonstrated the effectiveness of the method in providing models reproducing, using a tactile language, works of art otherwise completely inaccessible.},

abstract = {Information graphics-diagrams, plans, maps, plots and charts-are widespread in written communication. The ability to comprehend, use and create these graphics is an important skill that most of us take for granted. However, for those of us who are blind or have severe vision impairment access to such graphics is severely limited, restricting effective participation in the workplace, limiting educational opportunities, especially in art and design, mathematics, and science and technology, and constraining enjoyment of popular media including the web. Lack of access to maps and plans of public spaces and buildings also contributes to one of the most disabling consequences of being blind: the difficulty of leaving the safety of home and having to find one's way in a new environment. Tactile graphics are currently the best way of providing access to graphical material for those who are blind. However they are usually produced manually by skilled transcribers and so are time consuming and expensive to create. For this reason technologies that provide effective, low-cost, on-demand accessible graphics have been a \&{\#}x201C;holy grail\&{\#}x201D; of accessibility research for several decades. Fortunately, new technologies developed for mobile devices, gaming and graphics recognition now make this goal achievable. In this talk I will describe the GraVVITAS project (http://gravvitas.infotech.monash.edu/). We are developing new computer technologies that are designed to work on touch screens and to provide people who are blind or have severe vision impairment with fast, inexpensive access to a wide variety of information graphics at home, at school and at work.

In this important and essential new textbook, she introduces the reader to the craft of using grounded theory in social research, and provides a clear, step-by-step guide for those new to the field.Using worked examples throughout, this book also maps out an alternative vision of grounded theory put forward by its founding thinkers, Glaser and Strauss. To Charmaz, grounded theory must move on from its positivist origins and must incorporate many of the methods and questions posed by constructivists over the past twenty years to become a more nuanced and reflexive practice.Essential reading for students, new researchers and seasoned social scientists alike, this book is one of those rare things, a textbook that is both accessible to those new to the field but also one that has important things to say about the nature of social enquiry itself.},

Our analyses revealed that more than 80{\%} of all themes were discoverable within two to three focus groups, and 90{\%} were discoverable within three to six focus groups. Three focus groups were also enough to identify all of the most prevalent themes within the data set. These empirically based findings suggest focus group sample sizes that differ from many of the "rule of thumb" recommendations in the existing literature.

abstract = {People with a sight problem can face many barriers when visiting museums and galleries. Talking Images is a user-led research project that has aimed to explore these barriers and offer solutions to improve access at museums, galleries and heritage sites for blind and partially sighted people. The project has been a collaboration between RNIB and Vocaleyes and has involved blind and partially sighted people in extensive consultation and research. A team of 12 blind and partially sighted auditors visited a wide range of venues across the UK. The auditors compiled over 60 detailed reports on audio guides and other services used at these venues, along with comments on the welcome and customer service they received. The venues that participated in the project also completed questionnaires on the services they provide, along with information on policy, training and marketing. In addition, 270 blind and partially sighted people took part in a phone survey, which examined people's experiences at museums, galleries and heritage attractions. Drawing on the findings of this research, Vocaleyes undertook case studies in partnership with three venues to develop new audio tours. Each project was overseen by consultative groups of blind and partially sighted people who advised the development of the projects from the initial stages through to evaluation. The poster presentation will outline the scope of the project and partnerships, the various research studies, their aims and findings, and quotes from the auditors and focus group members on their experiences at museums, galleries and heritage sites across the UK. Prior knowledge of the topic is not assumed. The paper does not contain advanced technical content. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an automatic method for remov-ing reflection interference when imaging a scene behind a glass surface. Our approach exploits the subtle changes in the reflection with respect to the background in a small set of images taken at slightly different view points. Key to this idea is the use of SIFT-flow to align the images such that a pixel-wise comparison can be made across the input set. Gradients with variation across the image set are assumed to belong to the reflected scenes while constant gradients are assumed to belong to the desired background scene. By correctly labelling gradients belonging to reflection or background, the background scene can be separated from the reflection interference. Unlike previous approaches that exploit motion, our approach does not make any assump-tions regarding the background or reflected scenes' geom-etry, nor requires the reflection to be static. This makes our approach practical for use in casual imaging scenar-ios. Our approach is straight forward and produces good results compared with existing methods.},

abstract = {To coincide with emerging arts and health practices, University College London Museums \& Collections and University College London Hospitals Arts partnered to create a pilot project, entitled “Heritage in Hospitals”, which sought to assess whether handling museum objects has a positive impact on patient wellbeing. Quantitative data from 32 sessions conducted with patients in May through July (inclusive) of 2008 demonstrated, on average, an increase in self-reported measures of life satisfaction and health status after handling museum objects. Constant comparative analysis of the qualitative data collected from the sessions revealed two major recurring themes: “impersonal/educational” and “personal/ reminiscence”. The first theme included instances where handling museum objects allowed patients to access truths about the objects ascertainable solely through touch (such as gauging weight, texture, temperature, and spatial relation to the body), to verify what was seen, to facilitate an intimate and imaginative connection with the museum objects and their origins, to investigate and explore the objects, to permit an interaction with the “rare” and “museum-worthy”, and to assist with aesthetic appreciation. The second theme illustrated the project's potential to assist with counselling on issues of illness, death, loss and mourning, and to help restore dignity, respect and a sense of identity (particularly among elderly patients) by providing a springboard for reminiscing and the telling of life stories in a highly institutionalized setting. This paper contextualizes the project, explores the implications of the project's methodology and its findings, and provides questions for future research. Key},

In particular, we briefly review one raised-line method where important features are emphasized. This paper focuses primarily on the effects of such emphasis and on comparing both raised-line and relief methods (produced by a Tiger Braille printer) through psychophysical experiments including discrimination, identification, and comprehension (involving 14 sighted and 6 blind subjects). Results show that raised-line pictures outperform relief images in all three tasks. Also, emphasizing important features significantly increases comprehension of tactile graphics. Raised-line images, however, disregard intensity/colour information unlike relief pictures. A technique incorporating intensity into raised-line graphics is also presented. Further experiments show the validity of this technique.},

@article{Lau2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.While the concept of visual saliency has been previously explored in the areas of mesh and image processing, saliency detection also applies to other sensory stimuli. In this paper, we explore the problem of tactile mesh saliency, where we define salient points on a virtual mesh as those that a human is more likely to grasp, press, or touch if the mesh were a real-world object. We solve the problem of taking as input a 3D mesh and computing the relative tactile saliency of every mesh vertex. Since it is difficult to manually define a tactile saliency measure, we introduce a crowdsourcing and learning framework. It is typically easy for humans to provide relative rankings of saliency between vertices rather than absolute values. We thereby collect crowdsourced data of such relative rankings and take a learning-to-rank approach. We develop a new formulation to combine deep learning and learning-to-rank methods to compute a tactile saliency measure. We demonstrate our framework with a variety of 3D meshes and various applications including material suggestion for rendering and fabrication.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyse quantitatively the visitors' perception of authenticity in two different types of museums: archaeology versus modern and contemporary art. The research is based on 1288 questionnaires collected from June to September 2011 among the visitors of the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology ({\"{O}}TZI) in Bolzano and the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MART) in Trento-Rovereto. Logit models were used in order to estimate the set of independent variables that significantly influence both the perception of the authenticity and the ?virtual? choice between the two types of museums considered. The results suggested that the authenticity perception was related to peculiar authenticity-related factors and by specific socio-demographic characteristics of the interviewee, although some common elements emerge. In particular, {\"{O}}TZI authenticity is linked to its uniqueness in the world, whereas MART visitors relate authenticity to the museum's building and the perception that it was not just a tourist attraction. The empirical evidence confirms the well-known concept that authenticity perception is a dynamic experience, depending on the peculiar characteristics of the attraction analysed.

abstract = {This paper examines people's reasoning about identity continuity (i.e., how people decide that a particular object is the same object over time) and its relation to previous research on how people value one-of-a-kind artifacts, such as artwork. We propose that judgments about the continuity of artworks are related to judgments about the continuity of individual persons because art objects are seen as physical extensions of their creators. We report a reanalysis of previous data and the results of two new empirical studies that test this hypothesis. The first study demonstrates that the mere categorization of an object as "art" versus "a tool" changes people's intuitions about the persistence of those objects over time. In a second study, we examine some conditions that may lead artworks to be thought of as different from other artifacts. These observations inform both current understanding of what makes some objects one-of-a-kind as well as broader questions regarding how people intuitively think about the persistence of human agents.},

abstract = {Many embedded platforms that support the creation of interactive smart objects have become available over the last years. Arduino, Raspberry Pi, electric imp, mbed, MSP430, and .NET Gadgeteer are examples of hardware platforms with very different properties and capabilities. In order to make interactive artifacts additional sensors, actuators, and networking elements are available for the different platforms. Additionally there are different software environments and development tools that support developers in creating custom applications for embedded systems. It is apparent that one size doesn't fit all and that choosing the right platform and tools is an important step towards an effective solution. In this TEI2014 studio we first provide an overview of available platforms and tools that allow developers to create novel and tangible interactive systems. We will present and discuss developing environments, with a specific focus on browser based programming tools and social coding. In a second step we will have 2 hands-on sessions, where in each we use a different platform and create an initial functional prototype. The aim is to provide the participants with an overview of existing embedded development tools suitable for creating interactive artifacts and to provide some hands on-experience with different new platforms.},

abstract = {Advances in the creation of computational materials are transforming our thinking about relations between the physical and digital. In this paper we characterize this transformation as a "material turn" within the field of interaction design. Central to theorizing tangibility, we advocate supporting this turn by developing a vocabulary capable of articulating strategies for computational material design. By exploring the term texture, a material property signifying relations between surfaces, structures, and forms, we demonstrate how concepts spanning the physical and digital benefit interaction design. We ground texture in case study of the Icehotel, a spectacular frozen edifice. The site demonstrates how a mundane material can be re-imagined as precious and novel. By focusing on the texture of ice, designers craft its extension into the realm of computational materiality. Tracing this process of aligning the physical and digital via the material and social construction of textures speaks back to the broader field of interaction design. It demonstrates how the process of crafting alliances between new and old materials requires both taking seriously the materialities of both, and then organizing their relation in terms of commonalities rather than differences. The result is a way of speaking about computational materials through a more textured lens.},

abstract = {We report the results of an extended empirical two-stage study on the aesthetics of hybrid objects that combine form and behaviour. By combining two shapes (spheres and cubes); two sizes (7.5cm and 15cm); two materials (fabric and plastic); and four behaviours (emitting light, emitting sound, vibrating or displaying no behaviour) we created 32 objects that differ for a single feature. In a between- participants study, 175 participants assessed and described the 32 objects. From this, seven dimensions were identified: pleasant; interesting; comfortable; playful; relaxing; special and surprising. In a second between-participants experiment 486 participants rated each object on the seven dimensions from the first study. Overall Spheres, Fabric, and Vibration were the preferred features, but for some of the dimensions specific combinations of features were rated more positively. This paper contribution is twofold: it provides a first study on the aesthetic of tangible interaction as a combination of form and behaviour outlining a potential instrument to measure it; and it provides empirical evidence of the value of experimenting with different forms (spheres) and material (fabric) even if they are difficult to create as they generate the strongest aesthetic effects.},

Physical prototypes allow us to give form to ideas and to evaluate the integration of form and function, two core components of tangible interaction. We discuss potentials and pitfalls when using off-the-shelf digital devices (by embedding a device, cracking it open and building on it, or collating board and parts) through six prototypes developed in two studies. Hacking devices to materialize our ideas proved excellent for fast prototyping. Technology imposed constraints and prompted different design solutions than initially intended offering unexpected ways to engage. On the basis of this experience we outline a process and offer guidelines for the fast prototyping of tangible interactions.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a study in which artists made line drawings intended to convey specific 3D shapes. The study was designed so that drawings could be registered with rendered images of 3D models, supporting an analysis of how well the locations of the artists' lines correlate with other artists', with current computer graphics line definitions, and with the underlying differential properties of the 3D surface. Lines drawn by artists in this study largely overlapped one another (75{\%} are within 1mm of another line), particularly along the occluding contours of the object. Most lines that do not overlap contours overlap large gradients of the image intensity, and correlate strongly with predictions made by recent line drawing algorithms in computer graphics. 14{\%} were not well described by any of the local properties considered in this study. The result of our work is a publicly available data set of aligned drawings, an analysis of where lines appear in that data set based on local properties of 3D models, and algorithms to predict where artists will draw lines for new scenes.},

abstract = {Petrelli et al. (2013) propose a movement that would empower curators, artists and designers in the creation, installation, maintenance and alteration of exhibits that are meant to bring materiality and physical interaction to the forefront of visitors' experience, while simultaneously expressing the values of the cultural institution. While many cultural heritage professionals would welcome this ability to create and integrate interactive exhibits into the design of exhibitions, for the majority there is a significant technical knowledge gap and the tools required to create these exhibits are still out of reach. In order to understand what methods and technologies could be suitable, we first need to ascertain the existing challenges and opportunities faced by cultural heritage professionals in designing interactive exhibits. The research focuses specifically on the working perspective of cultural heritage professionals, complementing existing studies on the design and implementation of interactive exhibits at cultural heritage sites. Based on interviews with professionals from a range of cultural heritage institutions across Europe, we investigate the existing curatorial practices, revealing the challenges faced when creating interactive exhibits, as well as the difficulties in relation to access, authorship, participation, creativity and control of such exhibits. We examine two aspects of the cultural heritage professionals' work practices in relation to interactive exhibits: 1) the attitudes and perspectives of curators and designers highlighting the values, goals and aspirations that are considered when creating exhibitions, and 2) current resources and methods used to create and implement interactive digital exhibits indicating the advantages and disadvantages of these. In conclusion, we outline the potential avenues that we are currently investigating that could aid cultural heritage professionals in the design and development of interactive exhibits. We discuss design implications to be considered in the creation of a hardware and software platform that would allow these professionals to bridge this knowledge gap.},

abstract = {Relief and contour lines on a group of ancient Greek red-figure vases and vase fragments in the collections of the Harvard Art Museums and the Worcester Art Museum were examined using two surface methods--reflectance transformation imaging and three-dimensional laser scanning confocal microscopy. These methods helped characterize the lines and answer questions regarding tools, techniques, and production sequence used by Greek vase painters. This research also incorporated fabricated mock-ups to gain a better understanding of the ancient technology and in so doing confirmed that the relief lines were not produced by an extruded method, but with a brush made with only a few hairs, termed linierhaar, as first proposed by G{\'{e}}rard Seiterle in 1976. Furthermore, it was discovered that two distinct types of relief lines exist on these ancient vases: the laid line (proposed by Seiterle), which has a characteristic ridged profile, and the pulled line (proposed in a previous publication by the authors), which has a furrowed profile. It was also determined that the relief line used to outline figures was applied prior to the contour line in Attic vase decoration, although variations in this sequence occur in vases from South Italy. Based on observations during this research, the authors propose a likely evolution for the techniques used to produce decorative features throughout the period of red-figure vase production.},

abstract = {The Swedish Pompeii Project started in 2000 as a research and fieldwork activity initiated by the Swedish Institute in Rome. The aim was to record and analyze an entire Pompeian cityblock, Insula V 1. Since autumn 2011 a new branch of advanced digital archaeology, involving 3D reconstructions and documentation methods, was added to the project agenda. The insula was completely digitized using laser scanner technology and the raw data were employed to develop different research activities in the area of digital visualization. This paper presents the recent results of the 3D interpretation of the house of Caecilius Iucundus. This research activity was developed employing a large variety of historical and archaeological sources such as: archaeological reports, historical image documentation (printed as well as in edited material) and analysis of the in situ structures. This work was characterized by the experimentation of a new workflow of data development, where the elaboration of the interpreted structures took place directly in virtual space, using the scanned model as geometrical reference. This method easily connected all the historical and archaeological sources collected for the interpretation, opening a new discussion about different possible interpretation of the house. Moreover, a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) was used in different occasions as platform where the different hypotheses could be discussed in the context given by the actual state of the archaeological structures. The use of an accurate and resolute replica of the site as a backdrop for the virtual reconstruction allowed a high level of control on the proposed hypotheses during the interpretation process. This study enabled the acquisition of new and important information about the house, thus, bringing a significant contribution to the archaeological analysis of Insula V 1, suggested as pilot project for wider use.},

abstract = {The recording of high resolution point clouds with sub-mm resolution is a demanding and cost intensive task, especially with current equipment like handheld laser scanners. We present an image based approached, where techniques of image matching and dense surface reconstruction are combined with a compact and affordable rig of off-the-shelf industry cameras. Such cameras provide high spatial resolution with low radiometric noise, which enables a one-shot solution and thus an efficient data acquisition while satisfying high accuracy requirements. However, the largest drawback of image based solutions is often the acquisition of surfaces with low texture where the image matching process might fail. Thus, an additional structured light projector is employed, represented here by the pseudo-random pattern projector of the Microsoft Kinect. Its strong infrared-laser projects speckles of different sizes. By using dense image matching techniques on the acquired images, a 3D point can be derived for almost each pixel. The use of multiple cameras enables the acquisition of a high resolution point cloud with high accuracy for each shot. For the proposed system up to 3.5 Mio. 3D points with sub-mm accuracy can be derived per shot. The registration of multiple shots is performed by Structure and Motion reconstruction techniques, where feature points are used to derive the camera positions and rotations automatically without initial information.},

abstract = {In recent times, archaeological documentation strategies have been considerably improved by the use of advanced 3D acquisition systems. Laser scanning, photogrammetry and computer vision techniques provide archaeologists with new opportunities to investigate and document the archaeological record. In spite of this, the amount of data collected and the geometrical complexity of the models resulting from such acquisition processes have always prevented their systematic integration into a geographic information systems (GIS) environment. Recent technological advances occurred in the visualization of 3D contents, led us to overcome the aforementioned limitations and set up a work pipeline in which was possible to put the 3D models not only in the context of data visualization but also in the frame of spatial analysis. The case study described is a part of the Swedish Pompeii Project, a research and fieldwork activity started in 2000 with the purpose of recording and investigating an entire Pompeian city block, Insula V 1. As an additional part of the research, a laser scanning acquisition campaign was conducted in the last few years. The resulting models were thus meant to be used to develop further research lines: Among these, a 3D GIS system was expected to be set up with the purpose to (i) collect in the same geo-referenced environment, different typologies of documentation gathered in the context of the Swedish Pompeii Project; (ii) inter-connect 3D models with the project website; (iii) use the third dimension as a further analytical field of investigation, in the form of spatial analysis and cognitive simulation.},

Much of his interpretation focuses on cognitive conflict-the idea that knowledge gets constructed when new information comes in conflict with the existing knowledge structure. He also considers the viability of knowledge, meaning that when we "know" something, we really only know that it works with everything we've learned so far. If we learn something new that conflicts with our existing knowledge, then that existing knowledge is no longer viable and is replaced by a new knowledge structure.},

abstract = {Comments on an article by A. D. Dreger (see record 2008-06871-004) which discusses transsexualism and gender identity. Alice Dreger's compelling history of the controversy surrounding J. Michael Bailey's book, The Man Who Would Be Queen, presents two opposing camps, each entrenched in a seemingly intractable and incompatible position. On one side are proponents of Blanchard's theory and the scientific research supporting it that served as the basis for Bailey's book. The theory suggests that a certain segment of natal men who undergo sex reassignment surgery to become women do so out of an autogynephilic sexual orientation--an erotic attraction to the idea of themselves as women. On the other side are the transwomen who strongly object to the theory, dispute the scientific basis for it, and maintain that their desire to change genders was not motivated by erotic desires, but instead was founded in an identity-based position that their bodies do not match their true selves, what Dreger termed the "feminine essence narrative." In this commentary, I hope to offer one interpretation that attempts to get at the core of this conflict. In doing so, I do not intend to take either position in the controversy or to suggest that one side's argument rests on firmer ground. I have chosen to write this commentary because I believe that the controversy provides an elegant example for illustrating the nature of how we come to understand our lives.

abstract = {Materials get different meanings in various products. Several aspects can be effective in how meanings are attributed to materials. In this current study we focus on sensorial properties of materials (e.g. roughness, glossiness, transparency, etc.) and manufacturing processes (e.g. polishing, joining, molding, etc.) as effective aspects in meaning attribution. 25 participants were asked to select products expressing five given meanings in which materials predominantly play a role: aggressive, nostalgic, professional, sexy and toy-like. Then, they were asked to appraise materials of their products (1) verbally through interviews and (2) on paper through a list of sensorial properties and manufacturing processes presented by five-point scales. In total 125 products were collected and analyzed. The most effective properties in the overall evaluation were identified. Certain properties were found to be effective in attributing particular meanings to materials. For instance, while transparency and smoothness were very much used for conveying the meaning of sexy, hardness and dark colors were frequently used for expressing professionalism in materials. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There are several tools used in materials selection processes by designers. However, they are mostly engineering based tools, which are dominated by numerical (or technical) material data that is mostly of use in embodiment or detailed design phases of new product development. On the other hand, product designers consider certain aspects such as product personality, user-interaction, meanings, emotions in their material decisions. In this regard, existing tools and methods do not fully support designers in their materials selection processes. This paper describes the development of a new materials selection tool holding the idea of [meaning driven materials selection].

abstract = {Product designers are expected to create products transferring certain ‘meanings'. Materials of products are used for supporting the intended meanings in product design; one material may convey luxury, another material can be associated with a particular culture. Designers who aim to select a material that will contribute to the meaning they intend to convey in a product are confronted with the difficulty that the materials universe is immense. Moreover, traditional sayings such as ‘wood is cozy', ‘metal is aloof' or ‘plastic is cheap' are less relevant and strict in today's design practice. Without a doubt, having insights into the role of materials for creating particular meanings has become more and more relevant in the domain of design. It is to be expected that materials are attributed different meanings in different products and contexts, affected by certain key variables. How do we experience materials around us? When do we think that a certain material is modern, elegant, sexy, feminine, or professional? This paper focuses on the main findings and implications of a Ph.D. research on ‘meanings of materials'. In this paper, the following two questions are addressed: (i) can a meaning be embedded in a material? and (ii) what are the key variables affecting the attribution of meanings to materials? In answering these questions, results from a literature review and a study conducted with 32 Dutch and Chinese participants are discussed. The paper ends with a discussion on existing materials selection sources and materials education in design.},

This system allows for self-calibration of printheads, 3D scanning, and a closed-feedback loop to enable print corrections. The integration of machine vision with 3D printing simplifies the overall platform design and enables new applications such as 3D printing over auxiliary parts. Further- more, our platform dramatically expands the range of parts that can be 3D printed by simultaneously supporting up to 10 different materials that can interact optically and mechanically. The platform achieves a resolution of at least 40µm by utilizing piezoelectric inkjet printheads adapted for 3D printing. The hardware is low cost (less than {\$}7,000) since it is built exclusively from off-the-shelf components. The architecture is extensible and modular – adding, removing, and exchanging printing modules can be done quickly. We provide a detailed analysis of the system's performance. We also demonstrate a variety of fabricated multi-material objects.},

abstract = {Current museum metadata tends to be focused around the properties of the heritage object such as the artist, style and date of creation. This form of metadata can index a museum's collection but cannot express the relations between heritage objects and related concepts found in contemporary museum exhibitions. A modern museum exhibition, rather than providing a taxonomic classification of heritage objects, uses them in the construction of curatorial narratives to be interpreted by an audience. In this paper we outline how curatorial narratives can be represented semantically using our CurateOntology. The Curate Ontology, informed by a detailed analysis of two museum exhibitions, draws on structuralist theories that distinguish between story (i.e. what can be told), plot (i.e. an interpretation of the story) and narrative (i.e. its presentational form). This work has implications for how events can be used in the description of museum narratives and their associated heritage objects.},

abstract = {The model of design taught in educational institutions in the United Kingdom and elsewhere has fundamental weaknesses. At best it is a partial and superficial description of what happens when individuals engage in the process of design. At worst it is inaccurate and misleading. The authors are working on multiple-perspective approaches to design education that emphasise the central importance of context to understanding design as human enterprise. In this paper, they introduce the idea of design as narrative. Like narratives, objects have power in social settings: they offer an interpretation of the story of their existence; they give back echoes of their past. To regard design objects as forms of text allows 'readers' to interpret them within their own frames of reference. The understanding that arises from this form of interpretation allows for creative involvement with objects and permits more realistic engagement with design work. It promotes a form of thinking that is personal, relevant and open to negotiated meaning in an otherwise increasingly prescriptive educational world.},

abstract = {Museums are sites where people encounter material objects. This article examines object and subject entanglements that take place at a university museum in northern Norway, and illustrates how objects shift identities as they interact with subjects and how subjects are also affected by the encounter. A relational materialities perspective, which demonstrates how object identity is related to the subject it engages with, allows multiple versions of objects to appear. Working as a certified expert in the university museum, the author aims to address the quandary over future museum collection policies. She argues that collection policies are not only about what to select but also who makes the selection decisions, and the perspectives associated with such choices. If museum collections are based on expert relationships to objects, the quality of the expert needs further investigation.},

Although current 3D printing pipelines still suffer from several restrictions, accuracy in reproduction has reached an excellent level. The manufacturing industry has been the main domain of 3D printing applications over the last decade. Digital fabrication techniques have also been demonstrated to be effective in many other contexts, including the consumer domain. The Cultural Heritage is one of the new application contexts and is an ideal domain to test the flexibility and quality of this new technology. This survey overviews the various fabrication technologies, discussing their strengths, limitations and costs. Various successful uses of 3D printing in the Cultural Heritage are analysed, which should also be useful for other application contexts. We review works that have attempted to extend fabrication technologies in order to deal with the specific issues in the use of digital fabrication in the Cultural Heritage. Finally, we also propose areas for future research.},

abstract = {The era of affordable 3D printing is clearly underway; indeed, the historical patterns of growth in 3D printing are, in many ways, strikingly similar to those associated with the growth of home computing in the late 1970's. One of the prominent areas of increased interest in 3D printing is in the realm of education: fabrication tools are becoming available to college undergraduates and high school students, and even to younger children. Accompanying this burgeoning growth, however, there is an acute need to consider the ways in which 3D printing should develop, as a technology, in order to accommodate the abilities and activities of youngsters. This paper discusses a number of technological challenges to be overcome in making 3D printing truly available to children over the next decade. The most prominent challenges described here include: (a) expanding the range of physical media available for printing, (b)incorporating ideas derived from "pick-and-place" mechanisms into 3D printing, (c) exploring methods for creating portable and ubiquitous printing devices, (d) creating tools for hand-customization and finishing of tangible printed objects, and (e) devising software techniques for specifying, altering, and combining 3D elements in the context of printing. By facing these challenges, we can provide children (and adults) with a remarkably powerful and expressive means for creating all sorts of personalized artifacts. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Misidentifying materials-such as mistaking soap for p??t??, or vice versa-could lead to some pretty messy mishaps. Fortunately, we rarely suffer such indignities, thanks largely to our outstanding ability to recognize materials-and identify their properties-by sight. In everyday life, we encounter an enormous variety of materials, which we usually distinguish effortlessly and without error. However, despite its subjective ease, material perception poses the visual system with some unique and significant challenges, because a given material can take on many different appearances depending on the lighting, viewpoint and shape. Here, I use observations from recent research on material perception to outline a general theory of material perception, in which I suggest that the visual system does not actually estimate physical parameters of materials and objects. Instead-I argue-the brain is remarkably adept at building 'statistical generative models' that capture the natural degrees of variation in appearance between samples. For example, when determining perceived glossiness, the brain does not estimate parameters of the BRDF. Instead, it uses a constellation of low- and mid-level image measurements to characterize the extent to which the surface manifests specular reflections. I argue that these 'statistical appearance models' are both more expressive and easier to compute than physical parameters, and therefore represent a powerful middle way between a 'bag of tricks' and 'inverse optics'. ?? 2013 The Author.},

Most of these artifacts carry messages in the Braille language. Our next goal, which defined this project's context, is to send the products to blind children inaugurating a novel way of communication and collaboration amongst blind and non-blind students.

We make three key contributions to marketing theory on authenticity: (1) when visitors are confronted with the inauthentic, they often experience feelings of dissonance; [21 there is a need to consider the role of authenticity of the self in consumption situations; and (3) there is a symbiotic relationship between indexical authenticity and iconic authenticity, and both are related to existential authenticity.

Digitization is enabling the juxtaposition of material from far-flung repositories and creating new ways of presenting historical insights as well as new types of historical engagements. New media can allow the assemblage of a multiplicity of voices, accounts, songs, and artworks, among other things - layers of meaning that are hard to capture and present in other formats, and which can be especially helpful in uncovering and accommodating non-Western perspectives. At the same time, the relationship of digital objects to actual artefacts' requires further consideration. This article investigates the implications of digitizing objects in cultural institutions, and the advantages and disadvantages of this process for those with differing interests in such objects. What are the effects for historical researchers, museum visitors or clan members with special ties to a museum artefact of viewing it on a screen rather than being in the object's presence, holding, seeing, smelling and hearing it, and connecting with the ancestors or relationships it embodies? Case studies from the UK, Australia and the Pacific are explored to address aspects of the impact of digitization initiatives on museum practice and on people's engagements with the past, with a focus on the affective qualities of digital objects.},

The approach focuses on two main design choices: (1) physical embodiment, by having people directly interact with the physical objects we want to augment and, (2) situated social interactions, by offering the possibility to share personal ideas and comment on others, to collaboratively produce stories about augmented objects. We also report about the main evaluation results we got in a workshop in which we studied users needs with respect to tangible interactive experiences in exhibitions of museums.},

@article{GloverFrykman2009,
abstract = {Background: In the 1950s and 1960s, many children experienced museums as dull and boring. Nowadays, museums seem to be much more conscious of their educational role and the need to make their exhibits attractive and interesting. Making use of narratives is one way of achieving this. Some scholars claim that narrative is central to meaning making in a learning context. This article illustrates the extent to which narratives are used in a museum learning context, the kinds of narratives used and their purpose. Purpose: The overall aim was to investigate the versatility of narratives in a learning and meaning-making context in a museum setting. The three-pronged research question is: to what extent is narrative used in the education texts produced by three selected museums and made available on their Internet websites, what kinds of narratives are used and what is their purpose? Method: Data was gathered in January and February 2006, following an extensive Internet search of Swedish museums and their downloadable education texts. Three museums were selected--Skansen, the Swedish Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of Science and Technology--each publishing a comprehensive up-to-date selection of education texts on their websites. A total of 134 digital texts specifically produced for students and teachers in connection with museum visits were studied and analysed. Each text was downloaded, sorted, labelled, saved and categorised electronically. The texts catered for different ages: infant and primary school (7-10 years), middle school (10-13 years) and secondary school (13-16 years). Analysis: A preliminary analysis strategy was developed on the basis of texts from the first museum chosen. Detailed adjustments to the analysis framework were made prior to a full analysis of the texts. Every downloaded text was read and re-read and documented according to the kind of narratives contained and their supposed purpose. Results: An analysis of the web-based education texts indicated that not only did the museums make use of narratives to different extents, but that different kinds of narratives were used for different purposes. Depending on the kind of narrative used, the results showed that the main purposes were to communicate by: (1) describing, constructing or reconstructing information; (2) interpreting what has happened, is happening now or might happen in the future; (3) constructing reality and making sense or meaning of it; (4) stimulating the imagination and encouraging creativity; (5) rendering teaching and learning more entertaining, imaginative and effective; and (6) acting as a resource to aid interaction, negotiation and communication. It was also apparent that the chosen museums used narrative to differing degrees depending on their respective traditions and circumstances. Conclusion: The study highlighted how the narratives used in the three museums' web-based education texts make a significant contribution to meaning making by stimulating imagination, encouraging reflection, drawing on existing experience and knowledge and sharpening visitors' curiosity. This is mainly achieved through the narratives' powers of description and analysis, and their ability to challenge existing attitudes and involve the visitor in historical and contemporary events and situations.

Full documentation of every process is key to guarantee the quality of the outcomes according to the industrial ap-proach to quality known as Quality Management, for example as described to ISO9001:2008. 1 Introduction The use of visual aids to model cultural heritage, besides textual description, has al-ways accompanied the design, planning, creation and documentation of monuments and artifacts. Recently, 3D models are increasingly used thanks to the visualization capabilities of computers and the availability of high-performance graphic cards. A further push to the adoption of 3D models comes from the diffusion of technologies like 3D scanning and photogrammetry that make 3D modeling a widely available methodology. Nowadays it is being adopted for mass acquisition of artifacts and monuments and 3D datasets are stored in an increasing number in openly accessible digital libraries. For example, there are projects aiming at populating Europeana, the European digital library, with 3D models of European art, archaeology and architec-ture masterpieces or creating tools for the creation of collections of digital replicas of cultural objects [1, 2]. However, issues have been raised about the quality of the 3D models and their suitability to become a substitute of the original, leading to the statement of widely accepted general principles [3]. An engineering approach to qual-ity is based on the quest for details and accuracy and measures quality in microns (model resolution) and number of polygons (level of detail: LOD). This approach is technology-driven and does not take into account the customers' requirements and perspective. It is also cumbersome to implement, because it requires ex-post verification of the model. Finally, it does not take into account the data acqui-sition conditions that might adversely influence the model quality, regardless of its},

We use the Digital Content Life Cycle model to study the relation between the different types of crowdsourcing and the core activities of heritage organizations. Finally, we focus on two critical challenges that will define the success of these collaborations between amateurs and professionals: (1) finding sufficient knowledgeable, and loyal users; (2) maintaining a reasonable level of quality. We thus show the path towards a more open, connected and smart cultural heritage: open (the data is open, shared and accessible), connected (the use of linked data allows for interoperable infrastructures, with users and providers getting more and more connected), and smart (the use of knowledge and web technologies allows us to provide interesting data to the right users, in the right context, anytime, anywhere -- both with involved users/consumers and providers).

Digitizing museum objects in 3D (or the museums themselves, for that matter) with incredible accuracy and realism; examining the inside of a mummy; modeling collections in 3D; retaining virtual copies of vulnerable objects; all these and more already exist in the fast-changing realm of 3D applications.},

abstract = {Abstract: Stereoscopic 3D images, although going back to the mid-nineteenth century, are becoming pervasive in cinema, the Web, electronic games, television, graphic simulations, personal photography, and the entertainment and education ecologies. The use of stereo 3D goes beyond a technology vogue to the creation of effective experiences that are more naturally engaging for audiences by conveying real physical depth perception and the illusions of tangibility and tactility. This paper claims that because museums are all about compelling, memorable, and visceral experiences, 3D will become an increasingly important tool for exhibitions, education, and interpretation; the challenge will be to know when, how, and why to use it. Stereo 3D is described and a trajectory of examples of past and current museum use is presented. The paper also provides a rationale for why, when many technologies are vying for priority and resources, stereoscopic 3D technology should be near the top of the list.},

Increasingly, museum professionals are moving beyond technologically-driven reasoning to entertain new ways of conceptualizing both collections and information. This is leading to knowledge models beyond those already imagined. This paper considers the synergy between theoretical ideas in the academy and the computer ontologies that have been brought to bear on collections information. Drawing on user research findings from the Themescaping Virtual Collections project and the work of leading literary and media theorists, the paper examines how user needs and digital technologies are reformulating our understanding of museum collections and the relationships between museums and audiences.},

@article{Arnold2008,
abstract = {Context and purpose of the Research Agenda$\backslash$nEPOCH � Excellence in Processing Open Cultural Heritage � has been a Network of Excellence co-funded under the European Union�s Sixth Framework Programme, Priority 2, Information Society Technologies. EPOCH involved 95 partners from a wide range of perspectives, brought together to create a holistic view of the fi eld, integrating and enhancing the previously fragmented efforts in research directed toward intelligent information and communication technologies (ICT) for tangible cultural heritage. The target for these technologies is monuments, sites and museums and the collections of tangible heritage that they hold. Monuments and sites include castles, churches, monasteries, historic town centres, archaeological and other heritage sites.$\backslash$nThe Research Agenda is a distillation of debates and expert opinions on necessary future directions that have taken place both within the Network and beyond as this very inter-disciplinary group has shared a journey over increasing cross-fertilization of ideas and perspectives and engaged others in the debates. EPOCH was founded on a basis of taking the holistic view of the fi eld. As well as ICT researchers, the Network includes researchers in cultural economics, arts and humanities, social studies of cultural participation, cultural administration, regional regeneration and many other relevant fi elds of research-based guidance of policy making and professional work in the cultural heritage sector.$\backslash$nThis multi- and inter-disciplinarity is required to fully address the goals set by the European Union in the Lisbon Agenda to make the European knowledge society competitive in sustainable economic growth and employment and a good place to invest, live and work based on a high quality of life. Europe�s rich and diverse cultural heritage makes considerable contributions to the Lisbon Agenda. Cultural landscapes, historic towns, museums, monuments and other heritage sites benefi t the European tourism sector,$\backslash$nHeritage sites and museums show considerable multiplier effects in employment (one job in cultural heritage generating between fi ve and nine in related sectors), they drive citizen�s cultural learning and enjoyment, and also contribute in many other ways to the quality of life and regeneration of European regions and towns. ICT applications and digital content already add considerably to these societal benefi ts and there is much more to expect from new and enhanced technological capability. This expectation motivates dedicated funding of collaborative research projects under the 7th Framework Programme (e.g., the ICT Challenge �Digital Libraries and Content�) and the fl agship project of a European Digital Library under the i2010 Information Society focus Digital Libraries.$\backslash$nYet, there is much to do to deliver the potential benefi ts. EPOCH�s effort to provide a common research agenda in cultural heritage and ICT is intended to foster a better cohesion of the communities involved, promote synergies among new initiatives and projects, yield more effi cient spending of available funding, and result in better and more sustainable ICT-based solutions.},

This type of heritage is usually located in neighbourhoods among the public, who live and interact with them on a day to day basis. The paper recognises the challenges involved in requiring non-experts to use software and hardware for 3D graphics, which are not yet of common use. Hence, the research has been focused from early stages to gather feedback in order to lower the threshold of 3D technologies. Specifically, this paper addresses the development and use of tools to allow users to create 3D content and integrate it with semantic information. The information is disseminated in a Web based format. As a result, the public sculptures and monuments database supports scholar and public dissemination by presenting a variety of integrated documentation on the project Web site: http://www.publicsculpturesofsussex.co.uk.},

abstract = {For nearly two decades, virtual reality (VR) technologies have been employed in the field of cultural heritage for various purposes. The safeguard, the protection and the fruition of the remains of the past have gained a powerful tool, thanks to the potentialities of immersive visualization and 3D reconstruction of archaeological sites and finds. VR applications based on videogame technologies are known for their realism and fluid interactivity, but the choice of the fittest technologies remains a complex task because there is an ample number of hardware devices and software development kits. Moreover the design of a VR application for cultural heritage requires several different professional skills and presents a certain complexity in coordination and management. This paper presents strategies to overcome these problems, by suggesting some guidelines for the development of VR systems for cultural heritage. It illustrates a complete methodology to create a virtual exhibition system, based on realistic high-quality 3D models of archaeological finds (reconstructed using a 3D Scanner and a high definition camera) and a low-cost multimedia stereoscopic system called MNEME, which allows the user to interact in a free and easy way with a rich collection of archaeological finds. The solution we propose is intended to be easy to transport and fully usable by different user typologies, without any external assistance or supervision. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The 3D-COFORM project will provide solutions aiming at making 3D documentation a common practice in the cultural heritage sector. This requires the definition of good practices for data acquisition and storage, together with the design of a novel documentation system for the acquisition and simplification procedures. In fact, these initial steps are often undocumented, and this makes the outcome unreliable for the strict criteria of heritage documentation. The following steps of storing, managing, searching and displaying 3D objects is still an uneasy process, and the project aims at providing state-of-the-art tools to improve the performance in all these stages. Finally, the project will address business processes, mainly through the design and start-up of a Virtual Competence Centre in order to provide guidance to cultural heritage institutions and practitioners wishing to incorporate 3D into their everyday practice.},

abstract = {Despite the rising commodification of heritage sites and practices, children engagement in their own cultures remains incredibly low, greatly endangering the future preservation of nations' unique nonrenewable resource. Considering children's very early engagement with cultural attitudes and identities, it is increasingly critical to develop a deeply rooted culture of responsibility and conservation from the earliest years, ensuring that children naturally feel invested in their surroundings. Unfortunately, heritage education remains largely undervalued, with most efforts relying on in-person experiences in formal cultural institutions. This paper thus aims to explore how heritage education can be redefined, using some of the most innovative virtual imaging and artificial reality technologies to at once expand access and engagement with one's ownhistory. Though there have been introductory applications of this edutainment multimedia technology, it will require a multidisciplinary team to create heritage programming which is as entertaining as it is intellectually challenging for young children.With the rich resources of 3D imaging and interactive programming already at our disposal, we are well-equipped to do so, given a coordinated effort. 1.},

While technological effort has been mainly invested in improving the “accuracy” of VR (determined as how truthfully it reproduces the “CH reality”), issues related to scientific requirements, (data transparency, separation between “real” and “virtual”, etc.), are largely neglected, or at least not directly related to the 3D outcome, which may explain why, after more than twenty years of producing VR models, they are still rarely used in the archaeological research. The paper will present a proposal for developing VR tools as such as to be meaningful CH research tools as well as a methodology for designing VR outcomes to be used as a communication medium in CH museums},

abstract = {Key to introducing information and communication technologies in museums is to support meaning making activity in encounters with artefacts. The study presented in this paper is exploratory in nature and investigates the use of social and mobile technologies in school field trips as a means of enhancing the visitor experience. It is anchored in sociocultural perspectives of learning as meaning making, with a focus on mediating artefacts in the development of understanding. The Museum of London (MoL) was selected as the site of the study and the participants were a Year 9 History class (13-14 years olds) in a secondary school in Milton Keynes. The paper considers evidence of meaning making from students' online posts on Twitter (http://twitter.com) and activity on-site. Observational data, the visit's Twitter stream and post-visit interview data with the participants are presented and analysed. A mixed-method approach is employed to interpret the museum visit and examine young people's experience in the museum. Such an approach allows useful insights and shapes the understanding of how social and mobile technologies have an impact on the social dynamics of a school trip to a museum. Specifically, it explains the role of such tools in fostering the social interactions around museum artefacts and ultimately the process of shared construction of meaning making.},

After a brief introduction on the technical aspects of 3D technologies, specialists from academic and public libraries discuss their experience implementing 3D services, with a special focus on newly established partnerships. In addition, they comment on the impact of the technologies on their institutions and communities. Empowering users to scan or create 3D objects often results in a growing collection of 3D digital files. An information scientist discusses how to manage these collections to ensure preservation and fair intellectual property practices. Finally, a museum professional describes creative ways of using 3D objects to enhance the museum experience and to expand the interaction of the public with museum artifacts. Following the presentations, the panelists engage in public discussion of the challenges and opportunities of these transformative technologies.},

abstract = {Contemporary museums are much more than places devoted to the placement and the exhibition of collections and artworks; indeed, they are nowadays considered as a privileged means for communication and play a central role in making culture accessible to the mass audience. One of the keys to approach the general public is the use of new technologies and novel interaction paradigms. These means, which bring with them an undeniable appeal, allow curators to modulate the cultural proposal by structuring different courses for different user profiles. Immersive Virtual reality (VR) is probably one of the most appealing and potentially effective technologies to serve this purpose; nevertheless, it is still quite uncommon to find immersive installations in museums. Starting from our 10 years' experience in this topic, and following an in-depth survey about these technologies and their use in cultural contexts, we propose a classification of VR installations, specifically oriented to cultural heritage applications, based on their features in terms of interaction and immersion. On the basis of this classification, aiming to provide a tool for framing VR systems which would hopefully suggest indications related to costs, usability and quality of the sensorial experience, we analyze a series of live examples of which we point out strengths and weak points. We then summarize the current state and the very next future, identifying the major issues that prevent these technologies from being actually widespread, and outline proposals for a more pervasive and effective use of Immersive VR for cultural purposes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Many cultural heritage organizations responsible for providing access to large online collections recognize the potential value that social tagging systems can add to their collections. Projects such as Steve.Museum aim to give online users a voice in describing the content of publicly-held collections of digital heritage, through online social tagging and annotation tools. However, there are a number of unresolved challenges associated with re-using community tags, aggregating them within the museum's authoritative metadata stores and incorporating them within museum "metasearch" services. Although social tagging sites provide simple, user-relevant tags, there are issues associated with the quality of the metadata, the scalability compared with conventional indexing systems and a lack of interoperability across social tagging and annotation systems. In this paper, we propose an integrated system that overcomes many of the limitations of social tagging systems and maximizes their potential value-add within the context of museum collections. The Harvesting and Aggregating Networked Annotations (HarvANA) system firstly enables communities to attach tags/annotations to digitized 3D museum artefacts through web-based annotation services. The annotations/tags are represented using a standardized but extensible Resource Description Framework (RDF) model and an ontology-directed folksonomy. This approach facilitates interoperability between tags/annotations. Secondly, the system uses the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) API to automatically harvest the annotations/tags from distributed community servers. The harvested annotations are aggregated with the authoritative museum metadata in a centralized metadata store. The HarvANA system provides a streamlined, interoperable, scalable approach that enables cultural organizations to leverage community enthusiasm for tagging and annotation, augment their institutional metadata with community tags and enhance their discovery and browse services over 3D models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Due to the evolution of technologies and methods for realistic 3D reconstruction of objects, in many projects it can be found efficient ways to make research results in digital preservation available on the Internet. 3D visualization of cultural heritage is highlighted in this scenario, helping to expand research activities in this field by providing proper tools to allow for example, remote access to historical artifacts. Thus, visualization systems must be able to handle important aspects in the context of digital preservation, such as user profiles, security and ease access to 3D models. This paper presents the development of an effective web-based 3D visualization system whose architecture offers an easy and fast interactivity with 3D models even when limited computer resources are available. The system has been successfully adopted in developing of 3D Virtual Museums in the Universidade Federal do Parana (UFPR) in Brazil, providing an important tool to promote research, educational, social and cultural activities. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract = {Information Technology (IT) has been put forth as a reasonable way to sustain visitor interest and encourage visit repetition in museums. Therefore, IT is becoming more common in museum settings and professionals express their need for more information about how their visitors interact with these systems. This dissertation is an attempt to answer this call. We propose three essays that deal with different aspects of museums and IT from a user-centered perspective.                 The first essay is an attempt to determine with a free simulation experiment how IT and more particularly websites can arouse interest for museological content. The second essay relies on a field study to analyze the influence of IT on affective and cognitive reactions during a museum visit, namely perceived enjoyment, perceived authenticity and learning. In the third essay, we use focus groups and questionnaires to explore visitor expectations towards a phenomenological experience and the role played by IT in visitor experience of the past.                 This dissertation contributes to research by (1) advancing our knowledge of IT dedicated to the cultural heritage area, and (2) identifying and understanding visitor perceptions of hedonic systems. By proposing a set of key dimensions that could be used for IT evaluation in the cultural heritage, this dissertation also offers actionable advices to museum professionals.

This enables simple, inexpensive and sustainable Augmented Reality applications in the cultural heritage and architectural area based on industry standards. The main idea is to use existing historic media from archives and superimpose them seamlessly on reality at the right spot. These locative layers are context sensitively telling the location's history and create the impression of a virtual time journey. The registration of the virtual objects in the video images is provided by a robust 6DOF tracking framework based on two technologies that work in tandem: an initialization step based on Randomized Trees and a frame-to-frame tracking phase based on KLT. The entire application runs in real time on current Ultra Mobile PCs and MIDs.},

abstract = {Tooteko is a smart ring that allows to navigate any 3D surface with your finger tips and get in return an audio content that is relevant in relation to the part of the surface you are touching in that moment. Tooteko can be applied to any tactile surface, object or sheet. However, in a more specific domain, it wants to make traditional art venues accessible to the blind, while providing support to the reading of the work for all through the recovery of the tactile dimension in order to facilitate the experience of contact with art that is not only "under glass." The system is made of three elements: a high-tech ring, a tactile surface tagged with NFC sensors, and an app for tablet or smartphone. The ring detects and reads the NFC tags and, thanks to the Tooteko app, communicates in wireless mode with the smart device. During the tactile navigation of the surface, when the finger reaches a hotspot, the ring identifies the NFC tag and activates, through the app, the audio track that is related to that specific hotspot. Thus a relevant audio content relates to each hotspot. The production process of the tactile surfaces involves scanning, digitization of data and 3D printing. The first experiment was modelled on the facade of the church of San Michele in Isola, made by Mauro Codussi in the late fifteenth century, and which marks the beginning of the Renaissance in Venice. Due to the absence of recent documentation on the church, the Correr Museum asked the Laboratorio di Fotogrammetria to provide it with the aim of setting up an exhibition about the order of the Camaldolesi, owners of the San Michele island and church. The Laboratorio has made the survey of the facade through laser scanning and UAV photogrammetry. The point clouds were the starting point for prototypation and 3D printing on different supports. The idea of the integration between a 3D printed tactile surface and sensors was born as a final thesis project at the Postgraduate Mastercourse in Digital Architecture of the University of Venice (IUAV) in 2012. Now Tooteko is now a start up company based in Venice, Italy.},

abstract = {Geomatics technics and methods are now able to provide a great contribution to the Cultural Heritage (CH) processes, being adaptable to different purposes: management, diagnosis, restoration, protection, study and research, communication, formation and fruition of the Cultural Heritage. This experimentation was done with an eye to encouraging and promoting the development of principles and good practices for recording, documentation and information management of cultural heritage. This research focuses on the documentation path of a cultural asset, in particular a Renaissance statue, aimed to achieve a three dimensional model useful for many digital applications and for solid reproduction. The digital copy can be used in many contexts and represents an efficient tool to preserve and promote CH. It can be included in virtual museum archives and catalogues, shared on network with cultural operators and users, and it permits the contextualization of the asset in its artistic and historical background. Moreover, the possibility to obtain a hard copy, reproduced through 3D printing, allows to reach new opportunities of interaction with CH. In this article, two techniques for the digitization of the terracotta bust of Francesco II Gonzaga, in the City Museum of Mantua, are described: the triangulation scanner and dense image matching photogrammetry. As well as the description of the acquisition and the elaborations, other aspects are taken into account: the characteristics of the object, the place for the acquisition, the ultimate goal and the economic availability. There are also highlighted the optimization pipeline to get the correct three-dimensional models and a 3D printed copy. A separate section discusses the comparison of the realized model to identify the positive and negative aspects of each adopted application.},

abstract = {Nowadays, cultural heritage is under threat and danger (pollution, natural disasters, wars, etc.). In this domain, cultural heritage management (CHM) as the art, vocation and practice of managing cultural heritage resources and as a multi-discipline research area has a vital role. In recent years, the innovations, improvements and rapid advances in traditional and geographic (GIS) databases, design computing, digital architecture and archaeology, imaging sensors and scanners, computer modeling software, haptic equipments and e-learning technology, as well as the affordability and availability of many powerful graphics workstations make metadata and 3D modeling techniques for CHM with e-learning and haptic rendering (virtual reality) functionality feasible. This paper addresses the application research issue of incorporating metadata and modeling in a CHM case study and discusses the related e-learning functionality. So, in this article, a practical project is used to demonstrate the functionality and the performance of the proposed 3D modeling metadata based CHM methodology. In particular, the processing steps from image acquisition to the 3D geometric and semantic description of the Galerius Palace "Octagonon" (Thessaloniki, Greece) in a 3D digital environment are presented. Also, emphasis is put on documenting the new term 3D modeling metadata for CHM and on discussing as an open issue the concept personalized e-learning CHM scenarios. The proposed methodology has 10-2 modeling accuracy (i.e. 1{\%} relative inaccuracy) and it is of interest for archaeology, architecture, virtual reality, e-learning, e-culture and virtual tourism. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Packing fragile heritage artefacts is a challenge almost all heritage organisations have to deal with when faced with the task of transporting or storing the artefacts. The packaging solution requires fitting the artefact correctly in order to ensure the protection and safety of the item; but also to be easy and cost effective to produce. Different techniques have been traditionally used, such as double boxing, padding negative spaces and cushioning braces. However, the introduction of 3D technologies for documenting these artefacts enables innovative uses of this data for packaging purposes. Hence, this paper proposes the use of the generative modelling language in order to produce unique 3D-fitted containers for packaging heritage artefacts which fit tightly the artefact, and can be made to be reusable and more durable than traditional packaging solutions. We propose to adopt an octet lattice as a low density internal structure to the proposed container. By combining the parametric package design, 3D meshes acquisition and 3D printing techniques, we present a technology based solution to the traditional problem of protecting these valuable artefacts for transportation and/or storing purposes.},

abstract = {Almost everything that is written or said about the use of information technology within archaeology relates to hardware and applications and there is a general poverty of (published) material which considers the implications of the application and use of these tools on the way that the discipline of archaeology is practised. Although we are gener- ally comfortable with the idea that technology has changed the way we live our everyday lives, and the ever-increasing pace of that change, for some reason there appears to be a general reluctance to consider that such changes and the pace of these changes may also impact on archaeology. This paper proposes that computer-using archaeologists have for too long ignored a critical area of research: the consequences of the new information and communication technologies we use. Archaeologists point with justifiable pride to the tradition of self- critical analysis of new ideas and methodological changes within the subject. Archaeolo- gists question their data, their methodologies, their theories, their conclusions, the very basis of their subject, yet it appears that archaeology operates within a “bubble”, some- how immune to the consequences of the new technologies that are more and more a part of both the world around us and of archaeology itself. Furthermore, archaeologists are accustomed to theorising about technological changes in the past (ranging from new flint technologies, bronze and iron working, the evolution of the plough, developments in literacy, and so on), and may bring new perspectives to contemporary analysis of the technological world around us.},

Available : Yann Retrieved : 30 Abstract : Reconstitution of whole ceramics from fragments is a true priesthood for ceramographers . This activity remains mainly handled by manual sketching and can be very time consuming . However , more and more tools and workflows provide digital solutions , based on 3D technologies , to assist such tasks . In this paper , we present an application of photogrammetry on ceramic fragments from two excavation sites located in Brittany , France . This study was required by two ceramics specialists and conducted in CReAAH , a French research center in archaeology , archaeosciences and history . The 3D restitution by photogrammetry of these different fragments allowed reconstructions of the original shapes of the potteries or at least to get to as close as possible . We furthermore used the resulting 3D models of the ceramics to compute various metrics required by the ceramographers . In collaboration with IRISA , a French research center in computer science , we designed and generated a presentation support using a 3D printer . This work is based on affordable tools and illustrates how 3D technologies can be quite easily integrated in archaeology process with limited financial resources , to obtain useful results for the study and analysis of such artefacts .},

    abstract = { The concept of resilience has evolved, from an individual-level characteristic to a wider ecological notion that takes into account broader person–environment interactions, generating an increased interest in health and well-being research, practice and policy. At the same time, the research and policy-based attempts to build resilience are increasingly under attack for responsibilizing individuals and maintaining, rather than challenging, the inequitable structure of society. When adversities faced by children and young people result from embedded inequality and social disadvantage, resilience-based knowledge has the potential to influence the wider adversity context. Therefore, it is vital that conceptualizations of resilience encompass this potential for marginalized people to challenge and transform aspects of their adversity, without holding them responsible for the barriers they face. This article outlines and provides examples from an approach that we are taking in our research and practice, which we have called Boingboing resilience. We argue that it is possible to bring resilience research and practice together with a social justice approach, giving equal and simultaneous attention to individuals and to the wider system. To achieve this goal, we suggest future research should have a co-produced and inclusive research design that overcomes the dilemma of agency and responsibility, contains a socially transformative element, and has the potential to empower children, young people, and families. }

abstract = {Abstract The biological, cognitive, and social changes that occur in adolescence stimulate young people to think about themselves, reflect on the kind of people they want to become, and find their place in society. Traditionally, these changes have been explained by Erikson's theory and Marcia's identity status model, but process-oriented models of identity provide new insights. In particular, dual-cycle models, such as the three-factor identity model, focus on the dynamic process by which young people iteratively form and maintain their identity over time. This iterative process is captured by the interplay of commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as by distinct identity statuses. Furthermore, the extent to which adolescents find a stable identity is intertwined strongly with their psychosocial functioning and well-being.},

        abstract = {Touchscreens are the predominant medium for interactions with digital services; however, their current fixed form factor narrows the scope for rich physical interactions by limiting interaction possibilities to a single, planar surface. In this paper we introduce the concept of PickCells, a fully reconfigurable device concept composed of cells, that breaks the mould of rigid screens and explores a modular system that affords rich sets of tangible interactions and novel acrossdevice relationships. Through a series of co-design activities ? involving HCI experts and potential end-users of such systems ? we synthesised a design space aimed at inspiring future research, giving researchers and designers a framework in which to explore modular screen interactions. The design space we propose unifies existing works on modular touch surfaces under a general framework and broadens horizons by opening up unexplored spaces providing new interaction possibilities. In this paper, we present the PickCells concept, a design space of modular touch surfaces, and propose a toolkit for quick scenario prototyping.}

abstract = "This paper introduces Hybrid Prototyping as a way to couple different prototyping methods; combining their complementary affordances and mitigating their limitations. To characterise and investigate this approach, a simulation-based study was conducted into the coupling of low-cost 3D printing and LEGO®. Key benefits hypothesised are reduced fabrication time and increased reconfigurability. Six primitive 3D shapes are simulated using a continuum of hypothetical brick sizes. Results show a reduction in fabrication time of 45% and a reconfigurability of 57% at the optimum. A case study highlights the compounded improvements over 3D printing for an iterative prototyping process. These findings mean that increases in prototyping iterations can be made due to reduced time and material costs, accelerating the product development process."

In doing so, transmedia storytelling is positioned as a philosophical lens that mediates the intersection of print and digital creative writing. A combination of textual analysis and media specific analysis is used to establish and articulate patterns of cohesion in an array of various transmedia and literary works. Based on this analysis, the research proposes a theoretical framework for transmedia narrative cohesion that establishes links between literary and narrative theory, media studies, and social semiotics. The framework draws from, and is applied to, the creative work Martyrs: The life and afterlife of Collin Ampersand, arguing 'the book', as a physical artefact, still plays a vital role on the continuum of narrative innovation and experimentation.},

    abstract = { This article argues that the concept of `identity' is of limited heuristic value and proposes that it may instead be more useful to deploy the notion of narratives of location and positionality for addressing the range of issues normally thought to be about collective identity. Location and positionality (and translocational positionality) are more useful concepts for investigating processes and outcomes of collective identification — that is, the claims and attributions that individuals make about their position in the social order of things, their views of where and to what they belong (and to what they do not belong) as well as an understanding of the broader social relations that constitute and are constituted in this process. This enables a complete abandonment of the residual elements of essentialization retained even within the idea of fragmented and multiple identities so favoured by critics of unitary notions of identity. The article will draw on research into the ways in which experiences of `race' and ethnicity were articulated in the narrations produced by British-born youngsters of Greek Cypriot background. }

Narratives in the families were evoked through shared discussions of artifacts and objects displayed within homes and often spanned a number of years and related to family histories and cultural identities. The study considers the interplay between artifacts and oft-told narratives within families. The implications of these home-produced narratives are considered for family literacy education."

Unpacking commitment and exploration: Validation of an integrative model of adolescent identity formation. Journal of Adolescence, 29, 361–378.] was extended using data from two late adolescent samples (total N=703). A fifth dimension, labeled ruminative (or maladaptive) exploration, was added as a complement to two forms of reflective (or adaptive) exploration already included in the model (i.e., exploration in breadth and exploration in depth). Results indicated that ruminative exploration was positively related to distress and to self-rumination. The two forms of reflective exploration, by contrast, were unrelated to well-being and positively to self-reflection. Ruminative and reflective exploration also helped to distinguish between two types of less adaptive identities (i.e., Ruminative Moratorium and Diffused Diffusion) in a six-cluster solution that also contained adaptive types of identity. Implications for current research on identity formation are discussed."

abstract = {This chapter introduces a sequence of four papers that focus on the theme of knowledge and information flow in hybrid and virtual sites of interaction. As the Internet and the World Wide Web proliferate, people live increasingly hybrid lives where the physical and the digital, the real and the virtual, interact. In this world, online and offline identities may overlap and interdigitate, erasing prior boundaries in social, cultural, linguistic, political, and economic domains. My central argument proposes that we are witnessing an underlying process of technology-spurred blurring, resulting in major shifts in the cultural landscape of the 21st century. Providing context for the papers, I argue that the blurring of boundaries and the fusion of the real and the virtual in hybrid settings may require rethinking conventional ethnographic methods in the future, and beyond that, the actual problem space for anthropology. To frame the papers methodologically, I suggest that we are in a process of experimentation during which conventional ethnographic methods are being adjusted, or will need to be adjusted, to the requirements of a truly hybrid ethnography, i.e., one that combines research in virtual and real-world spaces. I specifically examine some of the issues that arise in and for online and offline research, gauging the impact on core concepts in anthropological ethnography such as "fieldsite" and "participant observation.".},
